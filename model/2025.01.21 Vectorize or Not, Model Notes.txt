2025.01.21 Vectorize or Not, Model Notes
// So one thing to fix here: this is the 'unvectorized' version of this model. vecteroize and just remove all the n. 
// Why is this poisson log?
// This is poisson_log bc then the predictor does not need to be exponentiated
// Why does this not include the.....no. Okay, doesn't need a sigma bc its a poisson and poisson distributions only have a lambda parameter.

// vectorized (supposedly) version I tried that doesn't work
//  C ~ poisson_log(a[route,species] + b[species] .* year + c[observer_ID]);
