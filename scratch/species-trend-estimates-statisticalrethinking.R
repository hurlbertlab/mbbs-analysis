#can use either brms' 'make_standcode' function
#or rethinking's 'ulam' function to build the stan model

#Okay so, summary: yeah, I can make a poisson model run. BUt the outputs are not making sense, because it's all just giving me the intercept. And none of the other information relevant to the model. This will require another couple statistical rethinking videos I think. Also downloading Grace's poptrends git and working through script_bayes_model_trial.R

#set up model paramaters
#for the moment. Let's begin with the count ~ year specification. I just want to 
#get a bayes model running, and from there we will add in observer and the route
#hierarchy.
#Testing purposes - just one species.

#Warning: 500 of 2000 (25.0%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 10.
#See https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings for details.
#If this is the only warning you are getting and your ESS and R-hat diagnostics are good, it is likely safe to ignore this warning, but finding the root cause could result in a more efficient model.

#We do not generally recommend increasing max treedepth. In practice, the max treedepth limit being reached can be a sign of model misspecification, and to increase max treedepth can then result in just taking longer to fit a model that you donâ€™t want to be fitting.


#OKAY SO - part of the problem is that I think the priors are two wide. the traceplots are kinda buckwild bc things are starting SO far apart for the first guess, which is why those proposals are being rejected.
