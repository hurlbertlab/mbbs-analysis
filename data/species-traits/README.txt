climate_position
 - For each species breeding distribution polygon, calculate mean and standard deviation for mean warmest quarter temp and precipitation (Worldclim 2.1). Then take the mean climate values for the study area and get a z-score for each species to measure how close to the species' mean conditions the climate of the study area is. Multiple the z-scores for temp and precipitation to get the final 'climate position' score

ndvi_habitat selection
 - For each species get their mean ndvi + sd from every stop within the mbbs that the species has been observed on in 2024/2023. As of 2025.1.28, the ndvi was pulled from a 2012 ndvi .tif
