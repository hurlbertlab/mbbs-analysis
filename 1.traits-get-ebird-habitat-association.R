#okay so ebirdst_habitat() has been deprecated, reached out for help and will return to this file when I've got that further information/download in hand

#Because that information was computationally expensive to generate and underused (I believe youâ€™re the 2nd or 3rd person to contact us about these since we dropped them two versions ago), we no longer compute or provide this information in full. These were constructed from two model outputs, predictor importances and partial dependencies. The partial dependencies were expensive and have been dropped. However,  the R package still contains spatialized, weekly information on predictor importance. See the load_pi() function documentation.
