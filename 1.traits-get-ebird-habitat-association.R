#Because that information was computationally expensive to generate and underused (I believe youâ€™re the 2nd or 3rd person to contact us about these since we dropped them two versions ago), we no longer compute or provide this information in full. These were constructed from two model outputs, predictor importances and partial dependencies. The partial dependencies were expensive and have been dropped. However,  the R package still contains spatialized, weekly information on predictor importance. See the load_pi() function documentation.

#so here you can plot like, the weekly distribution and then, question mark, how important the predictor is that week?
#so we want to use the breeding season only, let's set that as May-July, the weeks that the MBBS surveys are running. 
#so, in this case we'd what...add up the predictor importance of the various forest predictors? average the forest predictors?
#I guess add them...
#but also, important to remember, not every species is going to have every predictor. Probably at least one forest though yeah.
#be good to know the difference btwn open forest/sparse forest and the other forests

#subset can be used to select variable names, probably that will be part of the solution here
