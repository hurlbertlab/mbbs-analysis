Assumptions:

Ch2-
Raw land cover data, development never goes down, we use the running max of development. Going to need to justify, may need some satellite images
#run with raw and running max, stability analysis, doesn't change anything

Forest can't be identified accurately enough, so we combine broadleaf and deciduous - checked with satellite imagery already
